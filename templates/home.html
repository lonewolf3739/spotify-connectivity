        <h1>Back story & About this app</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/in/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> has started its services in India. I was trying to enjoy some music. I took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk" target="_blank">random walks</a> on Spotify Music Network to find good music. Guess what happened next? I built this app instead enjoying music.</p>
        <p>This app is largely inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation" target="_blank">Six degrees of separation</a> and Oracle of Bacon. Spotify's Web APIs provide enough data to build some cool apps.</p>
